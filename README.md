The code relates to issues that were performed during the laboratory in the subject Algorithms and Data Structures. 
The given algorithms concerned issues such as:
* Sorting (heapsort, quicksort, shellsort, insertion sort, selection sort). 
* Hash table,
* Hash Table open addressing
* Red-black tree
* Huffman coding,
* Longest common subsequence,
* Minimum spanning tree,
* Graph algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford).


The Java programming language was used for all topics.
